## About Me
 I am that woman who loves the environment, enjoys the mountains, the blue sky, and finds solace in her kayak. In places like these, I feel at peace with myself, away from the visual and auditory pollution generated by the city and its inhabitants. Here, I encounter a diversity of animals and vegetation, capturing their portraits with my camera to immortalize what catches my eye. Amidst this natural beauty, I discover a myriad of colors—greens, blues, reds, and yellows—accompanied by various scents and sounds. It is in these moments that I truly connect with the serenity and richness of the natural world.
